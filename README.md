# odin-etch-a-sketch

The objective of this project is to create a website that simulates the behaviour of a hybrid between a sketchbook and an Etch A Sketch game.

Upon completion of the project, I will have demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of Flexbox and JavaScript, including loops and functions for each feature.
