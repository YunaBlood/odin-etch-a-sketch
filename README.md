# Odin-etch-a-sketch
<p>The aim of this project is to create a website that simulates the behaviour of a hybrid between a sketchbook and an Etch A Sketch game.<br>
Upon completion of the project, I will have demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of Flexbox and JavaScript, including loops and functions for each feature.</p>
